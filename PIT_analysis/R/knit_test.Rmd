# John Day Steelhead Overshoot
## Bonneville AFF PIT tagging summary
### Summer 2020

---

_**Research Brief**_

<p>A collaborative research effort with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) and Oregon<br> State University (OSU), aiming to better understand individual adult migrations of John Day River<br> origin summer steelhead in the Columbia River between Bonneville and McNary Dams. The main<br> emphasis for this research targets the overshoot and fallback phenomenon, where the majority of John<br> Day origin steelhead overshoot the mouth of the John Day River during their upstream migration, and<br> continue upstream ascending McNary Dam before falling back and returning to the John Day River<br> later in the year.  </p>

_**Methods**_

Adult steelhead were sampled inside the adult fish facility at Bonneville Dam during the 2020 summer<br> field season in accordance to [Appendix G](http://pweb.crohms.org/tmt/documents/fpp/2017/final/FPP17_AppG.pdf) of the 2017 Fish Passage Plan. 
200 adult steelhead were<br> inserted with PIT tags between July 13th - September 18th
